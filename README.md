## MarriageApi is .Net5.0 WEB API app, uses Entity Framework Core and MSSQL server. 

### Database setup script is in Documentation directory. 

### Or generate DB automatically with a command inside Package Manage Console in VS: 

``` 
update-database 
``` 

### Change database connection string. It is in the Startup.cs file. 

### App comes with Swagger server, so it's easy to test. Just run it. 

### I'm not very familiar with WEB API's and more time would be required, so exception handling was left unimplemented.
